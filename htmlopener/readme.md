# HTML Opener

This project is a simple in-browser HTML opener that allows users to select an HTML file from their local system and view its content directly in the browser. 

## Project Structure

- **index.html**: The main entry point of the application. It contains the structure of the HTML opener, including a file input for users to select an HTML file and a display area for rendering the selected HTML content.
  
- **css/styles.css**: This file contains the styles for the application, defining the layout, colors, fonts, and other visual aspects to enhance user experience.

- **js/app.js**: This file contains the JavaScript code that handles the functionality of the HTML opener. It includes event listeners for the file input, reads the selected HTML file using the File API, and injects the content into the display area.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository or download the files to your local machine.
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser.
3. Use the file input to select an HTML file from your local system.
